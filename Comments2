# In these fix wall commands i need to specify the only group that feels the refelction.


# Up to 6 walls or faces can be specified in a single command: 
# xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo, zhi. A lo face reflects particles that move to a coordinate less than the wall position, 
# back in the hi direction. A hi face reflects particles that move to a coordinate higher than the wall position, back in the lo direction

# units value = lattice or box
# lattice = the wall position is defined in lattice units
# box = the wall position is defined in simulation box units
