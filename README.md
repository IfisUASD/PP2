Second program in Lammps about diffusion (Data extracted from Eddy's thesis) 

Now i can select the number of atoms, size, and concentration( % ).

i also put a new command (minimize) in order to run the program on my laptop.

minimize etol ftol maxiter maxeval
etol = stopping tolerance for energy (unitless)

ftol = stopping tolerance for force (force units)

maxiter = max iterations of minimizer

maxeval = max number of force/energy evaluations
