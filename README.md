Second program in Lammps about diffusion (Data extracted from Eddy's thesis) 

Now i can select the number of atoms, size, and concentration( % ).

Wall functions added now. Only interact with soluto group (Particles B).

I separated the particles A from the particles B (Bs are in the middle).

I also put a write.data file to print the postion at time t = 0, and the velocities. 

The log.lammps file has the general information.
